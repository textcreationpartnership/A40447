            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHen I obſerved that moſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who pretend to the greateſt Knowledge and Senſe, and abound moſt in Wealth and Plenty, are ſtrangely fond of <hi>Phyſic</hi> and <hi>Phyſitians;</hi> I could not but think that there muſt be a great deal of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity in the Profeſſorss, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the Art: But meeting with this little Book, written by an unknown <hi>French</hi> Author; which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to confute theſe general opinions, as vulgar errours; I have thought fit to Tranſlate the ſame, for the ſame reaſons which the Author hath given for Compoſing it in this his following</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MY deſign at firſt in beginning this little work, was only to laugh at ſome, who eating and drinking to exceſs, did afterwards abandon themſelves to Phyſic, for remedying the bad conſequence that attended their intemperance: But it is ſo difficult to put a ſtop to the vein of rallery, when thoſe who love it, have a knack that way; that I could not but make merry alſo with ſuch as are ſick, with the fear of Falling ſick: Nay I have not ſpared the Doctors, who ſooth up theſe fanciful Patients in their Viſions and Whimſies. This hath inſenſibly led me to ſpeak of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and their Art, that thoſe do ſay who througly know, but never make uſe of them, Inſtead then of a
<pb facs="tcp:104413:3"/> ſimple touch that I intended to have with junketting and intemperance; I have engaged in a quarrel with the bad practice of <hi>Phyſic;</hi> yet all along with the Foil, and not at Sharps, for 'tis no more but an Aſſault in a <hi>Fencing School,</hi> and not a real Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat I engage in: Beſides, I do confeſs that I ſhould not have purſued my raillery ſo far, if I had been the firſt who had opened that career; but coming after a great many others, I muſt needs take all the liberty I have uſed, that I might give a new Face to ſo old and beaten a Subject. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs all that is intended by it, is only to prove, that if a Man of a good conſtitution be any way Patient and Sober, he may without the help of <hi>Apothecary</hi> or <hi>Surgeon,</hi> enjoy perfect Health as long as he lives.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Dialogues</hi> are not of the nature of thoſe Plays, which for ſome years have pleaſed the Publick
<pb facs="tcp:104413:4"/> at the expence of <hi>Phyſicians.</hi> Here the <hi>Heart, Stomach,</hi> and other alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical Perſons ſpeak; much after the rate as our old Romance-makers have brought the Virtues and Vices into play. Or, to ſay better, as the Fable feigns, that the ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body complain of the <hi>Head.</hi> Yet if the invention be not altogether new, the method however, and diſpoſition is not common: For the Subject which links theſe <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi> to one another, makes them as ſo many <hi>Scenes</hi> in a <hi>Comedy.</hi> Now, though in the firſt, many times nothing is to be found but trifles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ornament or Life; yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing but that agrees with him that ſpeaks, and which tends to the mark aimed at, without loſing the allegory. It will be eaſie likewiſe to obſerve, that the more the matter is ſifted, the more alſo things are ſaid which require ſome attention. So that the laſt <hi>Dialogues</hi> are pretty different
<pb facs="tcp:104413:4"/> from the firſt, which will not a little contribute, if I be not miſtaken, to the rouzing of the Readers attention. The tenth is filled with new imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which require application, and the Eleventh drolls upon the bad practice of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> as much as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility will allow. As for the laſt, I thought fit to raiſe it a little higher than any of the former, becauſe in that, Nature was to ſpeak of the moſt ſublime parts of <hi>Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi> Perhaps ſome <hi>Philoſopher</hi> zealous for his opinion, having cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured this in equalitie of ſtile, will think it ſtrange that I ſhould as boldly pronounce concerning <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as concerning <hi>Phyſic.</hi> If it happen ſo, I ſhall be ſorry for it; but I entreat him to call to mind, that in ſuch occaſions every one is free to take what part he pleaſes: Nor did I think my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to betray my own Sentiments, to gratifie thoſe whom I know not.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:104413:5"/>
            <p>After all, if they may be believed who have read thoſe <hi>Dialogues,</hi> I aſſert nothing contrary to good ſenſe, and which may not be practiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple, or complaiance: Nay, they will have me to be a living in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the maxims I propoſe for living in Health, and without any need of <hi>Phyſic.</hi> In fine, they conclude that this little Peece, has Life and Spirit enough in it to make way for it ſelf in the world, and to gain credit there without the neceſſity of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour in the Front, or of an Apology in the Reer, becauſe they are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that whatſoever is ſaid in jeſt, ought never to be taken in earneſt.</p>

                  <p>Yes, by the Eyes of the Mind, but not of the Body, becauſe I begin my work in an unperceptible point; and from thence, as from a center, I trace to my ſelf a Circumference propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to that center, which I fill as I ought, under the cover of a Veil; for no man ever ſaw me openly at work, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,

Now that matter is no where to be found in greater abundance, nor more within my reach, than in the Air: And therefore, it is the Store-houſe of that precious Treaſure. Out of that vaſt Reſervatory then, which is above thy Head, and without the reach of thy Senſes, do I form the multitude of the Water-works which embelliſh the Graſs-plot of the World, and which riſe higher or lower, according as they draw their Influence from on High. For thou muſt know, that Life is but a gentle dropping of Living Waters, of which the Stars are as the ſources, and which falling from Heaven upon Earth, ſpurt out in all places upon this Theater of the Univerſe.</p>

And as Art ſtrives to imitate Nature, ſo does Nature labour to attain to the perfection of the Creator. But it is in vain for me to torment my ſelf, becauſe I depend on Principles: All that I can do then, is to put the Creatures in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo to govern them, that, if it be poſſible, before they have finiſhed their courſe, they may be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of leaving others after them that may trace the ſame footſteps. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe courſes are unequal, hence it is, that it is to be obſerved in me, that at the ſame time, and in the ſame place ſome Creatures are born, and ſome die; that ſome corrupt, and others tend to perfection; to which, as I have juſt now ſaid, they cannot attain; for my Power is no leſs ſtinted in the end than in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all my works.</p>

Farewel, make good uſe of the Acquaintance of that Savage; ſtudy his Conduct, and practice what be doth; that's the way to live long, and enjoy Health, without being burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to ones ſelf or to others. In fine, be perſuaded that the way he takes, is that which I moſt approve. Adieu.</p>

                  <p>The onely Caution you ſhould uſe, in reſpect of the Seeds wherewith the Soul of the World hath enriched yours, is to weed out of your Mind the
